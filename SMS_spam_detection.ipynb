    "Short Message Service (SMS) has become one of the most prevalent forms of digital communication worldwide, with over 3.5 billion phone users receiving text messages daily (Keepnet Labs, 2024). However, this widespread adoption has created significant security vulnerabilities. Spam SMSes are unsolicited messages to users, which can be harmful as SMS attacks can lead to theft of private data and spreading malware to other users (Kaspersky, 2020). A key factor contributing to SMS vulnerability is that unlike other messaging platforms such as Facebook and WhatsApp, SMS does not require an active internet connection, making it universally accessible and therefore particularly attractive to spammers (Bocereg et al., 2024).\n",
    "\n",
    "The economic incentive for spammers is substantial. Scammers using SMS scams stole an estimated $13 billion between January and June 2023 in the United States alone, while Americans received 77.5 billion automated spam texts throughout the same period (Ellis & Brandl, 2024). These attacks encompass unsolicited commercial messages, premium rate telephone service scams, and phishing messages seeking personal or financial data (Cloudmark, 2020)."

    "SMS spam detection presents unique technical challenges that distinguish it from other forms of spam filtering. SMS spam detection techniques are more challenging than email spam detection techniques because of regional contents and use of abbreviated words (Hidalgo et al., 2006). Additionally, existing email filtering algorithms may underperform due to factors such as lack of real databases for SMS spam, limited features, and informal language patterns (Roy et al., 2019).\n",
    "The constrained nature of SMS communication creates additional complexity, as SMS are usually shorter than email messages. Only 160 characters are allowed in standard SMS text, and that could be a problem because using fewer words means less information to work with (Amazon Web Services, 2023).\n"

    "TfidfVectorizer is used to vectorize the processed SMS messages for the Naive Bayes and Logistic Regression models. This approach converts text into sparse numerical vectors using Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) weighting, which emphasizes words that are frequent in a document but rare across the entire corpus. The vectorizer includes both unigrams and bigrams (ngram_range=(1,2)) to capture sequential word patterns common in SMS spam, such as \"specially selected\" or \"urgent mobile\". The min_df=2 parameter removes words that appear in fewer than 2 documents to reduce noise, while max_df=0.9 filters out overly common words that appear in more than 90% of messages. This creates high-dimensional sparse matrices that serve as input features for traditional statistical models algorithms, enabling them to identify spam patterns through statistical word importance."

It uses Keras tokenization to convert text messages into integer sequences, where each word receives a unique numerical identifier. Sequences are padded to a uniform length of 100 tokens to ensure consistent input dimensions for the neural network. This approach preserves word order and enables the embedding layer to learn dense word representations for each word during training.

    "All three models demonstrated exceptional performance in SMS spam detection, achieving accuracy scores exceeding 97%. The Naive Bayes baseline achieved 97.97% accuracy with perfect precision (1.0000) but lower recall (0.8397), while both Logistic Regression and Embedding Neural Network models reached 98.94% accuracy with more balanced performance profiles.\n",
    "\n",
    "The most interesting finding was the Naive Bayes baseline model's perfect precision, ensuring zero false positives while sacrificing recall by missing 16.03% of spam messages. This conservative approach makes it ideal for applications where blocking legitimate messages is unacceptable. In contrast, the Logistic Regression model achieved better balance with 0.9762 precision and 0.9389 recall, missing only 6.11% of spam while maintaining excellent precision. The Embedding Neural Network performed similarly with 0.9839 precision and 0.9313 recall, demonstrating that deep learning approaches offer minimal advantage over well-implemented statistical methods for this task.\n",
    "\n",
    "Cross-validation results revealed slight stability differences. Logistic Regression showed excellent consistency (mean F1: 0.9396 ±0.0133), while Naive Bayes exhibited moderate variability (mean F1: 0.8936 ±0.0453). The Logistic Regression model's low standard deviation indicates high stability across data splits, while the higher variability in Naive Bayes performance suggests greater sensitivity to data composition. The Neural Network's inability to use cross-validation due to its training methodology represents a practical limitation for performance validation."

    "Naive Bayes proved ideal for SMS spam filtering scenarios where blocking legitimate messages is unacceptable, such as business communications or emergency alerts. Its perfect precision ensures no important messages are lost to false spam detection. However, allowing 16.03% of spam messages to reach users undermines its effectiveness as a spam filter, potentially exposing users to malicious content and unwanted promotional messages.\n",
    "\n",
    "Logistic Regression emerged as the optimal SMS spam detection solution, successfully blocking 93.89% of spam while maintaining 97.62% precision. Its stability across different message types (spam and ham) and exceptional cross-validation consistency ensure reliable performance as SMS patterns evolve. The model's interpretable feature weights reveal which words and phrases most strongly indicate spam, with high positive coefficients identifying key spam indicators (e.g. \"free\", \"call phone_token\", \"txt\") and high negative coefficients revealing legitimate message patterns (e.g. \"ok\", \"got\", \"home\"). This can enable security teams to understand emerging spam tactics and adapt filtering rules accordingly.\n",
    "\n",
    "Embedding Neural Network demonstrated competitive spam detection capabilities but offered minimal advantages for SMS filtering applications. While its semantic understanding could theoretically detect sophisticated spam attempts using context manipulation, I believe that the short, pattern-based nature of SMS spam reduces these benefits. The model's computational overhead and training complexity are difficult to justify when simpler approaches achieve nearly identical effectiveness."

    "The minimal deep learning advantage could stem from several factors. SMS messages contain short, clear distinguishing patterns that statistical models capture effectively through TF-IDF vectorization with bigrams. The extensive preprocessing successfully extracted discriminative features, reducing the typical advantages of embedding-based approaches. Also, the dataset size (5,169 messages) may be insufficient for neural networks to demonstrate their full potential, as deep learning excels more with larger datasets requiring complex pattern recognition."

    "Embedding-based Neural Networks demonstrated limited practical advantages due to SMS messages dataset characteristics and size. Their computational overhead and infrastructure requirements make them less suitable for resource-constrained mobile environments, though architectural flexibility positions them well for future challenges."

    "Future improvements should explore ensemble methods combining Naive Bayes precision with Logistic Regression's balanced performance. For neural networks, investigating deeper architectures with multiple LSTM layers and pre-trained embeddings like GloVe or Word2Vec could enhance semantic understanding. Experimenting with different embedding dimensions (100, 200, 300), dropout rates (0.3-0.7), and learning rate schedules may optimize performance on larger SMS datasets. Advanced preprocessing could include character-level tokenization to handle SMS abbreviations and misspellings more effectively."
